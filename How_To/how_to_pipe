at the end of each child, just before execve
send pipefd to function
use 'dup' to create new file for the outfile

fork
if child :
if the child is not the first or the last :
cpy = dup(pipefd[0](stdin))
close pipefd
pipe(pipefd)
dup2()
NO !

the problem is the pipe i the same
reidrecting it seems to be the issue
but why stdin ??
i'm confused
god i feel dumb
maybe i am ?
think

there's something you missed in there
