use dup2
(dup just replace a specific fd, but you can't choose a specific new fd to assign)

for each child created, stdout will be replaced by pipefd[1] with dup2

for the parent, stdout will be replaced by the outfile


first child, stdin -> infile
first child, stdout -> pipefd[1](write)
other child, stdin -> pipefd[0](read)
other child, stdout -> pipefd[1](write)
last child, stdin -> pipefd[0](read)
last child, stdout -> outfile
